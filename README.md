# Storm
This is a bash script that uses Virus-Total API to automate the process of checking a list of IP addresses and return if they are malicious or not. This script could be useful for SOC Analysts since they use Virus Total to check some IP addresses, while it's fairly easy to check few IP addresses, but what if we have a really big list of IP addresses, then this script comes handy. 

Note:
An API key can be generate using this link https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002088769-Please-give-me-an-API-key.
